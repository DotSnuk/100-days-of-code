# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reading O'Reilly Head first python book. Learning about lists and how you can append lists and use loops

**Thoughts:** Very fun to have something to do when I get home. I'm listening to the Atomic Habits audiobook about how habits are formed and I hope that it will help me keep doing this in the future.
