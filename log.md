# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reading O'Reilly Head first python book. Learning about lists and how you can append lists and use loops

**Thoughts:** Very fun to have something to do when I get home. I'm listening to the Atomic Habits audiobook about how habits are formed and I hope that it will help me keep doing this in the future.

### Day 1: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the chapter on lists. Now I'm starting to get introduced to Dictionaries. 

**Thoughts:** Still a lot of fun! Got a little stuck on one of the problems I was to solve. Turns out I only misunderstood how to go about solving it.
One think that I hope helps is that I'm listening to Atomic Habits by James Clear, and getting familiar with how habits form.
So I've made some rules, and also try to change how I approach programming.
One of the rules is that when I sit down infront of the computer, I have to code (or read a course/text book about coding) for atleast 10 minutes before doing anything else.
Another rule is that when I get home from work, I will also code for atleast, hopefully more, for 10 minutes.
I also try to approach that every day I want to improve my skills in programming. I want to learn every day something about programming or getting more knowledgeable about programming.
