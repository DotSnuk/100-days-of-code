# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reading O'Reilly Head first python book. Learning about lists and how you can append lists and use loops

**Thoughts:** Very fun to have something to do when I get home. I'm listening to the Atomic Habits audiobook about how habits are formed and I hope that it will help me keep doing this in the future.

### Day 1: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the chapter on lists. Now I'm starting to get introduced to Dictionaries. 

**Thoughts:** Still a lot of fun! Got a little stuck on one of the problems I was to solve. Turns out I only misunderstood how to go about solving it.
One think that I hope helps is that I'm listening to Atomic Habits by James Clear, and getting familiar with how habits form.
So I've made some rules, and also try to change how I approach programming.
One of the rules is that when I sit down infront of the computer, I have to code (or read a course/text book about coding) for atleast 10 minutes before doing anything else.
Another rule is that when I get home from work, I will also code for atleast, hopefully more, for 10 minutes.
I also try to approach that every day I want to improve my skills in programming. I want to learn every day something about programming or getting more knowledgeable about programming.

### Day 2: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter on dictionaries, and other type of structured data (like sets, and tuples). Started chapter on functions.

**Thoughts**: This one I look forward to learning, so I don't have to keep all my code in one single place.
A side-note: Re-arranged my desk, added a second monitor, and rotated both of them to portrait mode so I know that when I sit infront of the computer, I'm supposed to be programming. This also helped since I can use the second monitor to have the pdf of the book I'm reading open and don't have to rely on my ipad (which has a smaller screen).

### Day 3: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter on functions and modules. Learning now how to make simple webapps.

**Thoughts**: Starting to see the point of learning a little day after day. Now I get to see some graphical stuff on my screen other than that in the IDE (although itÂ´s very simple stuff, it's still progress). It's going to be a lot of fun to see how much I can do in a week, or better yet, month or longer :).

### Day 4: February 25 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter on webapps. Made a simple site that compares two strings and shows the common letters. Besides the book I'm reading, I decided to learn about how git works (the basics). Also trying to make a simple site that you can create a "account" with username and password and store it in a txt file, and later when you try to login see if it's correct.

**Thoughts**: Trying out this side project on my own and will see if I know enough that I can make it and figure it out. Might spend some time on it tomorrow and if it's a dead end and I have no idea on where to go, I'll continue with the python book im reading.
Also I don't think I need to use git now, for what I'm doing, but thought I would atleast learn the basics so I get into the habit of commiting stuff here so when I do need it, I know the most basic stuff atleast.

### Day 5: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued on webapps and how to write to files.

**Thoughts**: Have been exersising every day at work since it's "sportlov" (rough translation: sport week, or exercise week. A week in sweden when (at least schools) are closed and you're encouraged to engage in sport activities.) Have been programming the other days as soon as I get home even though we have exersiced, today I had to rest for two hours before I started coding. So I havn't done as much as usual, but atleast I have my minimum 1 hour done (that is pure coding, according to wakatime (https://wakatime.com/dashboard )) but that doesn't account for the time I spend reading the book I'm learning from.
Nevertheless, will finish this chapter and then see if I can make any progress on my personal project.

### Day 6: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the webapp, made the results readable in a HTML table

**Thoughts**: Last day of this week's "sportlov". Got the last exercise done for this chapter in Head First into python. Will spend more time on my personal project tomorrow. Don't know if I need to learn more about Jinja2 or html if I'm going to be able to make the site I want. Think it's kind of fun with html/css, but think I should focus more on python. Don't know since I'm so new to python that I should learn more about html/css before learning more basic programming skills. Have tinkered with html/css in the past but was a few years ago.
Will have to sleep on it and see if I can figure something out.
